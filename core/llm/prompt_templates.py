You will read extracted log fields (already curated and focused) and produce a highly technical, concise, and actionable analysis.

INPUT (extracted fields):
{content}

REQUIRED OUTPUT (use this exact structure and headings, concise bullet lists):
# Technical Summary
- (2-5 bullets of what happened end-to-end)

## Timeline
- (ordered bullets: key events with timestamps/ids if present)

## Anomalies
- (bullets: unexpected patterns, missing fields, sudden spikes, edge cases)

## Root Cause (if any)
- (one or two bullets identifying likely cause from evidence in the input)

## Suggestions
- (bullets: engineering actions, improvements, guardrails)

Keep it precise, professional, and avoid generic commentary.

Chunk {index}/{total} below. Produce a compact technical digest of ONLY this chunk:

- Notable anomalies:
- Possible causes:
- Metrics/IDs/fields to carry forward:

FINAL OUTPUT (strict format):
# Technical Summary
- (2-5 bullets)

## Timeline
- (ordered bullets, merge duplicates, keep IDs/timestamps if present)

## Anomalies
- (group, deduplicate, keep strong signals)

## Root Cause
- (one or two bullets, evidence-based)

## Suggestions
- (clear engineering actions)
